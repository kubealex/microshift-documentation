MicroShift is not on a regular release schedule.

You may view the release page [here](https://github.com/openshift/microshift/releases)

MicroShift is built from [OKD](https://www.okd.io/), the Kubernetes distribution by the OpenShift community. The OKD version currently used to build is `4.8.0-0.okd-2021-10-10-030117`

{{< warning >}}
The available community documentation is not currently compatible with the latest MicroShift source code.
It is recommended to follow the instructions in the [MicroShift developer preview documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_build_of_microshift/4.12), using one of the [no-cost Red Hat Developer subscriptions](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/02/10/how-to-activate-your-no-cost-red-hat-enterprise-linux-subscription).
